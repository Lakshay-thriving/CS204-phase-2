# CS204 - Phase 1: RISC-V Assembler

##  Introduction

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a **simple assembler** developed in **C++**.  
The assembler translates **assembly language code** into **machine code** for a **32-bit RISC-V ISA**.

### Key Features:
- **Handles file input/output** for processing assembly code.
- **Supports six instruction formats**: **I, R, S, SB, J, and UJ**.
- **Identifies 31 valid RISC-V instructions**.
- **Ignores or reports errors** for invalid instructions.

This project consists of **one main file (`code.cpp`)** and **seven separate header files** for instruction handling.

##  Instruction Formats

| **Format** | **Type** |
|-----------|---------|
| **I** | Immediate instructions (e.g., `addi x1, x2, 10`) |
| **R** | Register instructions (e.g., `add x1, x2, x3`) |
| **S** | Store instructions (e.g., `sw x5, 4(x6)`) |
| **SB** | Branch instructions with signed offset (e.g., `beq x1, x2, label`) |
| **J** | Jump instructions (e.g., `jal x1, fact`) |
| **UJ** | Jump instructions with immediate values (e.g., `jal x1, label`) |

##  Language Used
- **C++**

##  Usage

### **1️ Setup the Assembler**
- Ensure your assembly language code is stored in a text file named **`assembly_code.asm`**.
- Include the following **header files** in the same directory:
- Place **`code.cpp`** in the same directory.

### **2️ Compile the Assembler**
g++ code.cpp -o assembler
./assembler

### **Verification**
To verify your machine code , you can use "Venus Simulator" and match it with the machine code generated by simulator. It should match the code generated in 'ans.mc' file.
###** Assumption**
1. The .data: attribute has to be in a separate line.
2. The .text: attribute should also be in a separate line.
3. Label should be in different line than instruction.
4. There would not be any instructions in front of a label; instructions should be on the next line after the label.
5. The instruction can have spaces in between registers.
6. If any unspecified instruction is given, the code will ignore that instruction.
